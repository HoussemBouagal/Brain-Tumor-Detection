## 💡 Overview

This system automatically analyzes brain MRI scans and classifies them into four categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The goal is to support medical professionals and researchers with a fast, offline AI-based tool.

## 🎯 Model Performance

| Metric            | Value (%)   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Training Accuracy** | 90.80      |
| **Validation Accuracy**|90.60      | 
| **Testing Accuracy**  | 90.43      |


The model shows a high level of generalization and consistent performance on unseen data.
